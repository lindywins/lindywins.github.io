      <h2 class="case sum1">Summary</h2>
        <p class="case sum1 summ">My client was looking for a way to stand out and add their mark to a saturated cloud storage market. Initially, they were unsure of the best way to do this, and enlisted my help with creating an app. <span>The project timeline was 2 months.</span></p>
      <h2 class="case sum2">Role</h2>
        <p class="case sum2 summ"><span>I was the solo designer on this project.</span> My role was to research what was missing in the existing cloud storage market, narrow down the focus for the app, and then design visual and functional solutions. I also created the brand identity for my client. </p>
      <h2 class="case sum3">Problem</h2>
        <p class="case sum3 summ">I discovered a few key issues that were prevalent with other cloud storage apps:
          <ul class="case sum6">
            <li>It can be easy to run out of space</li>
            <li>Lack of security</li>
            <li>Inconsistencies when transferring files across platforms</li>
            <li>Pressure to upgrade can be annoying to users</li>

              <li>saving content you find on the web (links, images, videos, etc.)</li>

            </ul>
          <p class="case mini-top research">As well as the following collaborative features, which were inspired by their desire for leveraging the "network effect" to generate growth:</p>

              <li>sharing a single item with someone else (and vice-versa)</li>

            <p class="case blurb2">100% of my survey participants used cloud storage, so I had a good sample to work from. And, 100% used Google Drive, which confirmed them as my strongest competitor.</p>
        <img src="images/survey2-1.png" class="center mini-top sur2" alt="survey2">
          <p class="case mini-top blurb3">100% of participants also used cloud storage for personal use, with 61% using it for school as well, and 50% for business.

        <img src="images/survey3-1.png" class="center mini-top sur3" alt="survey3">
            <p class="case mini-top blurb4">Regarding collaboration, 78% of users used sharing/collaboration features in cloud storage apps, so this seemed to be a worthwhile feature as well. Only 21% of sharers used social media to share items though, which suggested that the client’s idea of “social sharing” might be limited. I chose to focus on shareable links as they were the most popular, and could cover email sharing and direct sharing as well. </p>
            <p class="case mini-top mini-bottom blurb5">One participant wrote in a request for “something hosting similar document-creation features as Google Drive, but with more emphasis on user privacy,” which seemed like a good goal for the app. Another wanted an app that was “less complex yet still comprehensive.” And most of all, people wanted something that was low cost with more space, which came up as an opportunity in my competitive analysis as well.</p>

          <h3 class="case b1">I started by brainstorming on paper to quickly connect my ideas.</h3>
            <p class="case b3">To separate the app from other brands focused on security, a more relaxing, peace of mind approach was taken. Instead of using fear tactics to scare users, Troop was designed to make them feel like their important files would be taken care of, and that everything was going to be ok.</p>
            <p class="case b7">Soft greens and friendly images were chosen to cultivate this effect. The color palette is serene and relaxing, evoking the peace of mind that comes from security. Green also suggests safety, stability, and endurance according to color psychology.</p>
            <p class="case b8">I chose Sansita One for the logotype to complement the curves of the logo. Avenir was chosen for the body text to provide a modern, businesslike feel that is still friendly and inviting.</p>
            <p class="case mini-top mini-bottom b4">The name Troop references a group of kangaroos, suggesting strength in numbers and also a military level of security. The kangaroo was chosen to embody the warm and cozy feeling of the brand, and for their protective pouches.</p>

Each user also mentioned emotions/feelings consistent with the desired brand, including relaxing, friendly, and non-threatening. The content was considered to be clear and understandable by all users.</p>

          <h3 class="case">Finally, I performed preference tests to get additional feedback on my visual design choices.</h3>
            <p class="case">One item stood out during testing: the folder (pouch) graphic for the dashboard. After the first preference tests, my users still expressed some dissatisfaction with the winning shield-shaped graphic. So, I experimented with a few new graphics and performed additional testing.</p>

        <div class="pref2">
          <p class="case mini-top bottom">In round 2, there was a tie between two of the new options, so I decided to combine them into one more graphic option. I also received feedback from testers that they wanted to see the graphic in context, so I changed the 3rd and final preference test to include the dashboard background. This round gave me a clear winner (the combined version from the previous round), and I was able to choose a graphic that 2/3 of my users preferred.</p>

        <h2 class="case t0">Conclusion - What I Learned</h2>
        <h3 class="case t1">Trust the process</h3>
          <p class="case t1 conch">While it was challenging starting a project without much direction from the client, I found that trusting the design process and taking the time to think through each step was extremely helpful. With research, the problems started to solve themselves, and when they didn’t, I was able to perform more testing to answer any additional questions that came up.</p>
        <h3 class="case mini-top t2">When in doubt, add instructions</h3>
          <p class="case t2 conch">What seems intuitive to me is not necessarily what is intuitive to other people! Sometimes brief instructions can make all the difference between a happy user and a frustrated user. Also, thinking about the text used on buttons can go a long way.</p>
        <h3 class="case mini-top t3">Be prepared to keep testing if needed</h3>
          <p class="case t3 conch">When time is running out and something still isn’t quite right, it can be tempting to move forward without exploring all of the options. However, it is much better to proceed with confidence knowing that you have found the best solution to the problem. With more time, I would have liked to perform even more testing of the app as a whole.</p>
        <h3 class="case mini-top t4">Brands must be cultivated</h3>
          <p class="case bottom t4 conch">Overall the feedback I received on my branding was positive, but a few users questioned the logic of my choices. This showed me that it is hard to please everyone, and through further research, I learned that even the most established brands have their critics. This inspired me to focus on creating something thoughtful and consistent, and aim to build brand recognition over time.</p>
