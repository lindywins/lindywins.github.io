      <h2 class="about">Childhood</h2>
        <p class="case bottom about">I’ve always been drawn to technology. The first computer I played with was an MS DOS beauty that had games on floppy disks (the kind that actually “flopped”). I later became addicted to more advanced computer games, and countless Nintendo 64 games after that. <span>Side note: I will buy you a beer if you can beat me at Super Smash Bros.</span></p>

    <!-- College -->
    <section class="blue2 college">
      <h2 class="about">College</h2>
        <p class="case bottom about">As an adult, I became a little more social. However, still a nerd, I chose to study Philosophy in college. I started asking a lot of questions, such as, why do we exist? And, why is that art? <span>This developed an open mind and the analytical thinking skills that I use to solve design problems today.</span> It also taught me how to simplify complex concepts, which has been especially useful when writing UX content. During my college job as a receptionist, I developed my visual design skills while designing posters and table cards advertising weekly specials and upcoming events.</p>

    <!--After college -->
    <section class="gray after-college">
      <h2 class="about">After College</h2>
        <p class="case bottom about">More recently, while working in insurance, I continued simplifying complex concepts for my small business clients. <span>I learned how to tailor the experience to each person and anticipate what their needs and questions would be.</span> While I enjoyed building relationships with people, I noticed something shift when my company decided to migrate everyone over to a new software program. I found myself asking a lot of questions again, such as, why are these icons inconsistent? And, why does this section cut off the text without warning? While others in my office complained about the change, I daydreamed about how the software could be improved. My passion for technology became hard to ignore. </p>

    <!-- Now -->
    <section class="teal2 now">
      <h2 class="about">Now</h2>
        <p class="case bottom about">I didn’t realize it at the time, but every stage of my life was leading me towards UX design. <span>I love working with people and with technology. I am a research junkie. I am happiest when I am learning, experimenting, and creating new things.</span> I am fascinated by how the human brain works. I am perpetually curious and have a passion for discovery.</p>
